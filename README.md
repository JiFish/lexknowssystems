Inner workings of the Mastodon bot [@LexKnowsSystems@botsin.space](https://botsin.space/@lexknowssystems).

## why? ⁉️

In the movie [Jurassic Park](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jurassic_Park_(film)) the character Lex Murphy (as played by [Ariana Richards](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ariana_Richards)) sits at a computer and upon recognising the operating system, declares ["this is a UNIX system, I know this!"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDxLa6P6exc&t=510s) (capitalisation from subtitles).

This bot imagines that the computer ran a different OS.

## which OSs? 🖥❓

Options are stored in [`images/`](https://github.com/dill/lexknowssystems/tree/main/images) directory and are based on a casual cruise of wikipedia and Google image search.

If I am using your image and you don't want it to be used any more, send a pull request.

If you have an image you'd like me to use, send a pull request :) Please try to:
  * keep images at about the right aspect ratio (see existing images) and apply [aspect ratio correction](https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/no-ms-dos-games-weren-t-widescreen-tips-on-correcting-aspect-ratio) for older systems
  * have them be of an operating system
  * not have them contain copyrighted/inappropriate content
  * name your file with underscores where spaces should be, this will be what's in the subtitle (minus path and extension)
